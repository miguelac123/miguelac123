ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Miguel!

I have 4 years of experience in customer service and technical support, and a BA in psychology. I really enjoy helping others and making their lives easier. My passion for technology and psychology has led me to UX research, a field that I look forward transitioning into.
